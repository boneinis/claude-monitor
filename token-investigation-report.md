# Token Count Investigation Report

## Summary
The current session showing 26,744,296 tokens is actually **correct** based on the data analysis. The high count is due to extensive cache usage by Claude.

## Key Findings

### 1. Session Duration
- Session ID: d0eceb2a-0030-4cae-b7de-84046b2d964e
- Start time: 2025-07-02T13:23:52.471Z
- End time: 2025-07-02T17:17:31.228Z
- Duration: ~4 hours (within the 5-hour session window)

### 2. Token Distribution
- Total messages in session: 1,112
- Messages with usage data: ~555
- Messages with high cache reads (>50k tokens): 519

### 3. Token Breakdown
The high token count comes primarily from cache reads:
- **Cache Read Tokens**: Most messages have 90k-99k cache read tokens
- **Regular Input Tokens**: Usually 0-5 tokens per message
- **Output Tokens**: Typically 28-200 tokens per message
- **Cache Creation Tokens**: Usually 100-3,000 tokens per message

### 4. Example Message Token Counts
```
Message 1: 0 input, 83 output, 1,453 cache create, 90,199 cache read = 91,735 total
Message 2: 0 input, 28 output, 1,311 cache create, 91,652 cache read = 92,991 total
Message 3: 0 input, 94 output, 162 cache create, 92,963 cache read = 93,219 total
```

### 5. Calculation Verification
- Single file total: ~59 million tokens
- getCurrentSessions() correctly:
  - Groups messages within 5-hour windows
  - Sums all token types (input + output + cache create + cache read)
  - Only shows sessions within the last 10 hours (2x session window)

## Conclusion
The 26.7 million token count is **accurate** and not a bug. This represents a Claude Code session where:
1. A large context was cached early in the session (~26k-32k tokens)
2. Claude repeatedly read from this cache (519 times with 90k+ tokens each read)
3. This is normal behavior for long conversations with extensive context

## Why This Happens
When Claude caches a large context (like project files, documentation, or conversation history), subsequent messages read the entire cached context. With Opus 4 model, this can result in very high token usage even for simple responses.

## Recommendations
1. The monitoring tool is working correctly
2. Users should be aware that cached context reads count toward token usage
3. Consider adding a breakdown view showing:
   - Base input tokens
   - Output tokens  
   - Cache creation tokens
   - Cache read tokens
4. This will help users understand where their token usage comes from
